# Ecommerce Project

This is a small ecommerce project designed as a code example. It is built using Next.js 13, React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features

- **Server-side rendering:** The home page is rendered on the server side to enhance SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Viewing the page source reveals items that are readily accessible to search engine bots for crawling.
  
- **Cart Functionality:** Users can add or remove items from the cart based on stock availability.
  
- **Dummy Data:** The project uses dummy data sourced from [npoint.com](https://www.npoint.io/) to demonstrate the fetching process.

## Wireframes & UI

Before starting the coding process, wireframes and UI were designed using Figma for a cleaner and straightforward approach. You can find the wireframes and UI designs in the `public/figma & wireframes` directory of this repository. Here is the link to the Figma files: [Ecommerce Figma Files](https://www.figma.com/file/4w92rhM4Ky9OTi430dhtBD/Ecommerce?type=design&t=9Df98T8vegi9wCnk-6).
